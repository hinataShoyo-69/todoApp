Things i learnt while building this todo application are as follows: (YT:Coding2Go)


1.In HTML, the attribute autocomplete="off" is used to prevent browsers from automatically filling in form fields with previously entered values. This can be applied to individual input fields, or to entire forms.

2.:root: Defines global custom properties (CSS variables) for the document. These variables can be used anywhere in the CSS by referencing them with the var() function.
:root vs html: While :root typically selects the <html> element, it has higher specificity than just using the html selector directly, so it can be useful when you want to ensure that your properties are applied globally.

3.1 inch = 72 points
  1 inch = 96 pixels

4.The caret-color property in CSS is used to set the color of the text cursor (also known as the "caret") in an input field, text area, or any editable content on a webpage. 

5.In CSS, the outline: none; property is used to remove the outline that is applied to an element when it is focused. By default, many browsers apply an outline to focused elements, particularly interactive elements like form inputs, buttons, and links, to indicate that they are currently active or selected. This outline is typically a visible, dashed or solid line that appears around the element.

6.In CSS, position: absolute; is used to position an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (i.e., an ancestor element with any position other than static, such as relative, absolute, or fixed). When an element is positioned with absolute, it is taken out of the normal document flow, meaning it no longer affects the layout of other elements on the page.


7.In CSS, the flex-grow property is used in flexbox layouts to control how a flex item grows relative to other flex items within a flex container. When you set flex-grow: 1;, you are telling the flex item to take up available space in the container, growing in proportion to other flex items that also have a flex-grow value set.

8.The flex-shrink property in CSS is used in flexbox layouts to control how a flex item shrinks when the flex container is too small to fit all of its items. Specifically, it defines the shrink factor of a flex item relative to other items in the container when there is not enough space available.

9.document.querySelector() is a method in JavaScript that allows you to select the first element within the DOM (Document Object Model) that matches a specified CSS selector. This method is very powerful and flexible because it enables you to select elements in the same way you would with CSS selectors.

10.The .preventDefault() method is part of the Event interface in JavaScript. It is used to prevent the default behavior of an event from being executed. In other words, calling this method will stop the browser's default action associated with the event.
